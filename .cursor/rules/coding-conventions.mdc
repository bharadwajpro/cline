# Coding Conventions
- Follow existing codebase variable naming conventions and style of code.
- Don't create unnecessary code, variables, methods or files
- Don't edit areas of code that need not be changed
- Try to reuse existing variables, methods, interfaces, code in an elegant way.
- Try to make changes as minimal as possible in an elegant way taking into both long and short term usecases of the code and developer time savings.
- Make the code intuitive and easy to follow
- Make sure the feature is complete. Check every where in the codebase to make sure nothing is missed unhandled.
- Double/Triple check your code to make sure it is serving intended usecase.
- If you are making repeated mistakes or stuck, pause for a moment and think of a robust plan before implementing code. Don't mindlessly wander and keep editing the same file over and over again.
- Plan everything properly and make sure your plan is exhaustive before implementing
